# Execution Report - F45 TUI Performance Optimization

## Summary

Added bounded log rendering for the dashboard log viewer so large persisted outputs do not overwhelm the TUI.

## Changes

- Added `tui_log_buffer_lines` to `AppSettings` with a default of `1000`.
- Added `truncate_logs()` in `src/synapse_os/cli/rendering.py` to keep only the newest lines and prepend a truncation marker.
- Updated `LogViewer` in `src/synapse_os/cli/dashboard.py` to optionally watch a log file, reload it when the file size changes, and render the truncated content.
- Updated `RunDashboard.action_show_logs()` to pass the log file path into the viewer and truncate the initial payload before opening the modal.
- Added unit coverage for truncation behavior and log viewer refresh handling.

## Validation

- `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_dashboard_log_viewer.py tests/unit/test_tui_rendering.py -q`
- `./scripts/commit-check.sh --no-sync --skip-branch-validation --skip-docker --skip-security`

## Residual Risk

The viewer currently uses file size changes as the refresh heuristic. This is sufficient for the MVP branch stack, but a future feature could switch to content hashing if operators ever need same-size rewrites to trigger refreshes.
